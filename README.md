## About

Onlineportfolio is a personal website to present projects, skills and contact details. It is intended to be a minimal, responsive, and easy-to-maintain portfolio that can be extended with new projects and content.

> If you want, I can adapt the tone (professional, casual), add a tagline, or include a project chosen as the highlight.

## Getting started

These instructions assume a typical JavaScript/Node front-end project. Update commands to match your project (npm / yarn / pnpm, framework CLI).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.x
- npm >= 6.x or yarn / pnpm

### Install

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tijnara/Onlineportfolio.git
cd Onlineportfolio
npm install
# or
# yarn
# pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the dev server (replace with actual command):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# npm start
# yarn dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 (or the port your project uses).

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```

Serve the built files locally to test:

```bash
npm run serve
# or using a static server:
npx serve dist
```

## Project structure

Update this to match the repository's actual layout.

- src/            — source code (components, pages, styles)
- public/         — static assets (images, favicon)
- docs/           — documentation and screenshots
- package.json    — scripts and dependencies
- README.md       — this file

---

## Deployment

Common deployment options:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any static host (S3 + CloudFront)

Example: Deploy to Vercel

vercel --prod
```

Add deployment instructions that match your setup (Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Actions, etc.).
